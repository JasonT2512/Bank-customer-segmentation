# Bank-customer-segmentation

# Introduction
PyCaret is an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that automates machine learning workflows. 

In this project, I will perform an unsupervised clustering of customer data from a bank with PyCaret. Customer segmentation is the process of grouping customers who share certain traits or characteristics into segments in order to optimize marketing strategy, maximize customerâ€™s value to the business, and improve customer experience and satisfaction.

pip install pycaret
